# NEO-Prediction-Analysis
1a. Description of the dataset: This NEO dataset has 90836 instances and 10 different features. This dataset compiles the list of NASA certified asteroids that are classified as the nearest earth object. We are intended to use 2000 instances randomly selected from 90836 instances of the data set to predict if target asteroids are hazardous or not.

1b. Research Question: Our goal is to use this dataset to predict a particular asteroid that is already classified as Nearest Earth Object(NEO) may or may not be hazardous. We want to learn from the dataset that whether a particular NEO surrounding us can harm the life on Earth and which features of the NEO are playing crucial roles.

1c. Learning Model: We used several classification models to predict the given model, separately Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

1d. 1d. Current Expectation: We are able to construct a relatively concise model to predict whether an identified NEO may or may not be hazardous.

1e. Evaluation: We will generate a report of accuracy score to assess the correctness of different models.
